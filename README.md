## Introduction 

[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) are a great way to extend your bots interactions. However, writing the JSON required to specify the card layout by hand can be cumbersome and error prone. And while using a [designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) is a good way to manually create cards this does not cover cards that are generated by code. PyAdaptiveCards allows you to author cards in native python without ever touching the underlying json. 

A code sample says more then a thousand words so the following code snippet ...

```python
from pyadaptivecards.card import AdaptiveCard
from pyadaptivecards.inputs import Text, Number
from pyadaptivecards.components import TextBlock
from pyadaptivecards.actions import Submit

greeting = TextBlock("Hey hello there! I am a adaptive card")
first_name = Text('first_name', placeholder="First Name")
age = Number('age', placeholder="Age")

submit = Submit(title="Send me!")

card = AdaptiveCard(body=[greeting, first_name, age], actions=[submit])
card_json = card.to_json(pretty=True)
print(card_json)
```

... produces this json ...

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "actions": [
        {
            "title": "Send me!",
            "type": "Action.Submit"
        }
    ],
    "body": [
        {
            "text": "Hey hello there! I am a adaptive card",
            "type": "TextBlock"
        },
        {
            "id": "first_name",
            "placeholder": "First name",
            "type": "Input.Text"
        },
        {
            "id": "age",
            "placeholder": "Age",
            "type": "Input.Number"
        }
    ],
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.1"
}
```
