## Introduction 

[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) are a great way to extend your bot interactions. However, writing the JSON required to specify the card layout by hand can be cumbersome and error prone. And while using a [designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) is a good way to manually create cards this does not cover cards that are generated by code. PyAdaptiveCards allows you to author cards in native python without ever touching the underlying json. 

A code sample says more then a thousand words so the following code snippet ...

```python
from pyadaptivecards.card import AdaptiveCard
from pyadaptivecards.inputs import Text, Number
from pyadaptivecards.components import TextBlock
from pyadaptivecards.actions import Submit

greeting = TextBlock("Hey hello there! I am a adaptive card")
first_name = Text('first_name', placeholder="First Name")
age = Number('age', placeholder="Age")

submit = Submit(title="Send me!")

card = AdaptiveCard(body=[greeting, first_name, age], actions=[submit])
card_json = card.to_json(pretty=True)
print(card_json)
```

... produces this json ...

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "actions": [
        {
            "title": "Send me!",
            "type": "Action.Submit"
        }
    ],
    "body": [
        {
            "text": "Hey hello there! I am a adaptive card",
            "type": "TextBlock"
        },
        {
            "id": "first_name",
            "placeholder": "First name",
            "type": "Input.Text"
        },
        {
            "id": "age",
            "placeholder": "Age",
            "type": "Input.Number"
        }
    ],
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.1"
}
```

... which looks like this in [Webex Teams](https://teams.webex.com) ...

## Usage with Webex Teams

Below is an example how to use pyadaptivecards with Webex Teams. 

### Using raw requests 

```python
import requests 
import json

from pyadaptivecards.card import AdaptiveCard
from pyadaptivecards.inputs import Text, Number
from pyadaptivecards.components import TextBlock
from pyadaptivecards.actions import Submit

auth_token = "<INSERT_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE>"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + auth_token
}

# Create card
greeting = TextBlock("Hey hello there! I am a adaptive card")
first_name = Text('first_name', placeholder="First Name")
age = Number('age', placeholder="Age")

submit = Submit(title="Send me!")

card = AdaptiveCard(body=[greeting, first_name, age], actions=[submit])

# Create attachment
attachment = {
    "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
    "content": card.to_dict(),
    "text": "Fallback Text"
}

# Create payload for the webrequest
payload = {
    "roomId": "<INSERT_YOUR_ROOM_HERE>",
    "attachments" : [attachment]
}

response = requests.post("https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages", headers=headers, data=payload)
```

### Using the webexteamssdk
The [webexteamssdk](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk) provides a great wrapper around the Webex Teams API that can be used to interact with the API in native python. The following example shows how to use pyadaptivecards with the newly implemented attachments option. 

```python
from pyadaptivecards.card import AdaptiveCard
from pyadaptivecards.inputs import Text, Number
from pyadaptivecards.components import TextBlock
from pyadaptivecards.actions import Submit

from webexteamssdk import WebexTeamsAPI

greeting = TextBlock("Hey hello there! I am a adaptive card")
first_name = Text('first_name', placeholder="First Name")
age = Number('age', placeholder="Age")

submit = Submit(title="Send me!")

card = AdaptiveCard(body=[greeting, first_name, age], actions=[submit])

# Create a webex teams api connection
api = WebexTeamsAPI()

# Create a dict that will contain the card as well as some meta information
attachment = {
    "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
    "content": card.to_dict(),
}
api.messages.create(roomId=room_id, text="Fallback", attachments=[attachment])
```
